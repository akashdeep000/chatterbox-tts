# Project Proposal: Scalable Chatterbox TTS Deployment on RunPod

## 1. Introduction & Executive Summary

This document outlines the proposal for the development and deployment of a production-grade Chatterbox TTS (Text-to-Speech) service on RunPod. The proposed solution is designed to be a scalable, high-performance system that supports custom-cloned voices and provides low-latency audio streaming, making it ideal for integration into demanding applications such as real-time AI chat services.

Our approach is to build a containerized, GPU-accelerated application that is both powerful and easy to manage. This will ensure a robust, maintainable, and cost-effective TTS solution that meets all specified requirements.

## 2. Client Objective & Acceptance Criteria

The core objective is to deploy a scalable Chatterbox TTS instance on RunPod that supports cloned voices and streams audio output for an AI chat application.

The project will be considered successful upon meeting the following acceptance criteria:

*   **A working Chatterbox TTS deployment** on RunPod, using a custom container.
*   **Support for custom cloned voices**, with a clear workflow for adding new voices.
*   **A dual-function API endpoint** that:
    *   Accepts `text` and a `voice_id` as input.
    *   Streams audio output in real-time as it's generated.
    *   Returns audio in a playable format (WAV or MP3).
*   **Clear documentation and/or scripts** for:
    *   Deploying the container on RunPod.
    *   Adding and managing cloned voices.
    *   Testing and calling the API.
*   **Support for concurrent requests** with reasonable throughput.

## 3. Proposed Technical Solution

We will deliver a containerized application running on a RunPod GPU instance. The system architecture is designed for scalability and real-time performance.

### Key Components:

*   **API Server (FastAPI):** A high-performance Python server will handle all client requests. It will expose two primary endpoints:
    1.  **WebSocket Endpoint (`/tts/stream`):** For low-latency, real-time audio streaming directly to the client as it's generated.
    2.  **REST Endpoint (`/tts/generate`):** For applications that require a complete audio file delivered in a single response.
*   **Chatterbox TTS Engine:** The core library responsible for synthesizing speech from text using the base TTS model and specified cloned voices.
*   **Containerization (Docker):** The entire application, including all dependencies and the TTS engine, will be packaged into a Docker container. This ensures portability and consistent deployment. The base image will be `nvidia/cuda:12.1.1-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu22.04` to leverage GPU acceleration.
*   **Persistent Voice Storage:** Cloned voice files will be stored on a RunPod persistent network volume, mounted into the container at `/voices`. This ensures that voices are preserved across pod restarts and deployments.
*   **Voice Management:** The system will feature a lazy-loading mechanism for voices. It will scan the `/voices` directory on startup to identify available voices but will only load a specific voice into GPU memory when it is first requested, optimizing memory usage.

## 4. Deliverables

Upon completion of this project, you will receive the following:

1.  **Complete Source Code:** The full Python source code for the FastAPI application, TTS engine integration, and voice management.
2.  **Dockerfile:** A fully configured `Dockerfile` to build the application container image.
3.  **Deployment Scripts & Instructions:** A step-by-step guide (`DEPLOYMENT.md`) detailing how to:
    *   Build the Docker image and push it to a container registry.
    *   Configure and deploy the pod on RunPod, including persistent volume setup.
    *   Upload and manage custom voice files.
4.  **API Documentation:** Clear documentation for both the REST and WebSocket API endpoints, with examples (`curl` for REST, Python script for WebSocket).
5.  **Voice Cloning Workflow:** A document explaining the offline process for creating new high-quality voice clones from audio samples.

## 5. Project Timeline & Cost

*   **Timeline:** We estimate a delivery time of **[Number] business days** from the project start date. A detailed project plan with specific milestones will be provided upon approval.
*   **Cost:** We propose a fixed-price contract of **[Amount]**. This covers all development, deployment support, and documentation as outlined in the deliverables.

## 6. Next Steps

We are confident that this solution will meet and exceed your expectations for a high-quality, scalable TTS service. To proceed, we recommend the following steps:

1.  **Review & Approve Proposal:** Formal approval of this proposal.
2.  **Kick-off Meeting:** A meeting to finalize the project timeline and discuss any remaining details.
3.  **Project Commencement:** Begin development and provide regular progress updates.

We look forward to partnering with you on this exciting project.
